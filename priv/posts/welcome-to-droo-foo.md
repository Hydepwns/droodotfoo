# Welcome to droo.foo

This is the inaugural post on the new droo.foo platform! This site combines several interesting technologies:

## Features

- **Terminal Interface**: Full Unix-like terminal experience powered by Raxol
- **Phoenix LiveView**: Real-time updates at 60fps
- **File-based Blog**: Markdown posts stored in `priv/posts/`
- **Obsidian Publishing**: Write in Obsidian, publish via API

## The Stack

Built with:
- Elixir + Phoenix 1.8
- LiveView for real-time updates
- MDEx for markdown rendering
- Monaspace Argon for that crisp monospace aesthetic

## What's Next?

Stay tuned for posts about:
- Building terminal UIs with Raxol
- Phoenix LiveView patterns
- File-based content management
- And more!
