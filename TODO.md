## [PHASE 4] RaxolWeb Extraction & Contribution

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Successfully contributed to Raxol framework
**Goal:** Extract proven web rendering from droodotfoo → contribute to Raxol framework

### Background

After analyzing Raxol (v1.4.1-1.5.4), discovered it's a native terminal UI framework (like htop/vim), not for web rendering. The web components referenced in integration memos **don't exist yet**. Our droodotfoo implementation is already production-quality for web terminal rendering.

**Decision:** Build RaxolWeb components by extracting droodotfoo's proven approach, then contribute to Raxol.

### Phase 4.1: Extraction (COMPLETED ✓)

**Completed Tasks:**

- [x] Designed RaxolWeb.LiveView.TerminalComponent API specification
- [x] Created `RaxolWeb.Renderer` - Core buffer→HTML engine with virtual DOM diffing
- [x] Created `RaxolWeb.Themes` - 7 built-in terminal themes (Synthwave84, Nord, Dracula, Monokai, Gruvbox, Solarized, Tokyo Night)
- [x] Built `RaxolWeb.LiveView.TerminalComponent` - Phoenix LiveComponent wrapper
- [x] Created interactive demo page at `/dev/raxol-demo`
- [x] Wrote comprehensive documentation (README.md, API reference)
- [x] Organized and pushed 4 logical commits to repo

### Phase 4.2: Validation (COMPLETED ✓)

**Completed Tasks:**
- [x] Added error handling and validation to Renderer
- [x] Added buffer validation with fallback rendering

- [x] Enhanced Themes module with validation and logging
- [x] All 67 tests passing with error handling

### Phase 4.3: Polish (COMPLETED ✓)

**Completed Tasks:**
- [x] Write comprehensive test suite (ExUnit) ✓ 67 tests passing
  - [x] Renderer tests (rendering, caching, diffing) ✓ 29 tests
  - [x] Theme tests (CSS generation, all themes) ✓ 16 tests
  - [x] Component tests (LiveView integration) ✓ 22 tests
- [x] Added @spec typespecs for all public functions
- [x] Buffer validation and error handling
- [x] Created usage examples (basic_terminal_live.ex)
- [x] Performance benchmarks (60fps capable, 90%+ cache hit ratio)

**Test Coverage:**
- `test/raxol_web/renderer_test.exs` - 29 tests
- `test/raxol_web/themes_test.exs` - 16 tests
- `test/raxol_web/liveview/terminal_component_test.exs` - 22 tests
- **Total: 67 tests, 0 failures** ✓

### Phase 4.4: Migration Prep (COMPLETED ✓)

**Completed Tasks:**
- [x] Copied polished code to Raxol repository (`../raxol/lib/raxol_web/`)
- [x] Migrated all tests to Raxol repository (`../raxol/test/raxol_web/`)
- [x] Copied benchmarks (`../raxol/bench/raxol_web_renderer_bench.exs`)
- [x] Created working examples (`../raxol/examples/raxol_web/basic_terminal_live.ex`)
- [x] Added comprehensive documentation
- [x] Organized into 5 logical commits in Raxol repo

**Raxol Repository Structure:**
```
../raxol/
├── lib/raxol_web/
│   ├── renderer.ex (with error handling & validation)
│   ├── themes.ex (with logging & validation)
│   └── liveview/terminal_component.ex

- [x] Cleaned up droodotfoo prototype code (removed 4,878 lines)
- [x] Updated droodotfoo to remove demo pages and STL viewer
- [x] Committed cleanup changes (40d1a71)

**Contribution Summary:**
